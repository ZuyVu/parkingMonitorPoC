This is an application built with Ionic + Angular.
## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install dependencies. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is also requred for Ionic to run. After Nodejs & npm are installed, run:

```bash
npm install -g ionic
```
And inside project folder, run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Open Development Server

```python
ionic serve
```
By default, the app should be available at http://localhost:8100/

Please use Chrome developer tool via 'Inspect' and toggle device toolbar for Ipad. This would allow the styling to work best.
